# Subtraction Isn't a Growth Model

Student growth is a topic that most everyone thinks they understand but when details emerge reactions range from general confusion
to frustration: Why does something so simple have to be so complicated? In reality, student academic growth is slightly
more complicated than most people think but much less complicated than much of what's written about it would lead one to believe.
A simple 5th grade story problem from outside of education helps to illustrate.

## A Tale of Two High Jumpers

Consider a situation where we're looking at the improvement in personal bests between two high jumpers, Anna and Judy.
Anna is a novice higher jumper and Judy is a world class competitor. Anna’s best jump in 2015 was 3 feet 6 inches and
improved to 4 feet in 2016. Judy’s best jump in 2015 was 6 feet 7 inches and improved to 6 feet 9 inches in 2016. The
world record high jump for females is 6 feet, 10 1/4 inches.

* Whose high jump changed more? Explain your answer.
* Whose high jump change is more remarkable? Explain your answer.
* Which high jumper improved more? Explain your answer.

Simple subtraction tells us how much each changed: 6 inches for Anna and 2 inches for Judy. However comparing Anna’s 6
inch improvement to Judy’s 2 inch improvement requires care.

Though it is certainly true that 6 inches is more than 2 inches, a 6 inch improvement for a novice is not more impressive than
a 2 inch improvement for an expert. Novices generally improve a lot when starting--often referred to as beginners gains.
Understanding Anna’s and Judy’s improvement requires one to compare them to their peer’s: those whose high jumping ability is
like theirs. A 2 inch increase for an elite high jumper is remarkable whereas 6 inches for a novice is typical.

## Subtraction isn't a growth model

A common belief among users of Georgia Milestones data is that one can simply subtract student scores from one grade to the
next and use those to evaluate student growth. Subtraction is what everyone learned to do in elementary schools when asked
to find how much a quantity had changed. As we’ll see, subtraction doesn’t address what we really want to look at.
For the Georgia Milestones, there are two problems with scale score subtraction.

1. Georgia Milestones assessment scores from year to year are not meant to be subtracted. Even though the scores have the same
subtracting them makes no sense: like subtracting your weight from your height.

2. And even if scale scores could be subtracted, as the high jumper story problem illustrates: Evaluating growth for
students starting at different places is harder than just simple subtraction because growth varies depending upon where
a student starts.

# Subtraction Isn't a Growth Model

Student academic growth is a concept that almost everyone thinks they understand. However, when details about
the student "growth model" emerge reactions range from general confusion to frustration: __Why does
something so simple have to be made so complicated?__ In reality, student academic growth is
slightly more complicated than most people think but much less complicated than much of what's written about
it would lead one to believe. A simple 5th grade story problem helps to illustrate this point.

## A Tale of Two High Jumpers

The story problem is drawn from a situation outside of education where we are asked to consider the
improvement in personal best high jumps for two high jumpers, Anna and Judy. Anna is a novice higher jumper and
Judy is a world class competitor. In 2015 Anna’s best jump was 3 feet 6 inches whereas Judy's was 6 feet 7 inches. The following season Anna improved to 4 feet and Judy to 6 feet 9 inches. The following figure illustrates
the high jump data for the two jumpers.

* Whose high jump changed more? Explain your answer.
* Whose high jump change is more remarkable? Explain your answer.
* Which high jumper improved more? Explain your answer.

Simple subtraction tells us how much each changed: 6 inches for Anna and 2 inches for Judy.
However comparing Anna’s 6 inch improvement to Judy’s 2 inch improvement requires care.

Though it is certainly true that 6 inches is more than 2 inches, a 6 inch improvement for a novice is not
more impressive than a 2 inch improvement for an expert. Novices generally improve a lot when
starting--often referred to as beginners gains. Understanding Anna’s and Judy’s improvement requires one to
compare them to their peer’s: those whose high jumping ability is like theirs. A 2 inch increase for an elite
high jumper is remarkable whereas 6 inches for a novice is typical.


## Subtraction isn't a growth model

A common belief among users of Georgia Milestones data is that one can simply subtract a student's scores from
one grade to the next and use the difference to evaluate student growth. Subtraction is what everyone learned to
do in elementary school when asked to find how much a quantity had changed. For the Georgia Milestones,
there are two problems with subtracting a student's scores from one year to the next.

1. The Georgia Milestones assessment scores from year to year are not meant to be subtracted. Even though
the scores have the same range, subtracting them makes no sense: like subtracting your weight from your height.

2. Even if scores could be subtracted, as the high jump story problem illustrated: Evaluating growth for
students starting at different places is harder than just simple subtraction because growth varies based
upon where a student starts.  


## Moral of the Story: Context Matters

In almost all sport, like high jumping, beginners tend to demonstrate larger gains than experts. Even with human height,
we take account of the age an individual when consider how much their height has changed: It is normal for toddlers to
grow 4 inches from one year to the next but it is not normal for adults to do the same. Just as in these familiar
areas, context matters in student academic growth.

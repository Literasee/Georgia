# Introduction: Georgia Model of Student Growth

## Why student growth?

A primary goal of education is to enable student learning. Student growth is an attempt to capture that learning.
As something that happens over time, learning is not something observed in a single moment but in a succession of
moments.

The Georgia Model of Student Growth uses results from Georgia's annual assessments to determine each student's growth
in various content areas and grades. The impetus for the Georgia Model of Student Growth is:

* Data availability
* School & Educator Evaluation

Data availability is made possible by state testing that tracks student progress over time. Data derived from
those tests is then used to calculate student growth in the form of a [Student Growth Percentile](https://github.com/Literasee/Georgia/blob/master/module_2.md).
With student growth percentiles available for students participating in Georgia's annual assessments, the quantities are then
used as part of school and educator evaluation systems.


## Policy background

The foundation for the Georgia Model of Student Growth is the state assessment system that allows the
state to annually capture the attainment of students in several content areas and grades. The annual
testing of students is a requirement of policy initiatives dating back to the federal No Child Left Behind
legislation that mandated states to perform annual testing of students and use the results as part of
school accountability systems. Later, Georgia was a received a Race to the Top grant requiring the state
to use student outcomes from large scale assessments as a part of teacher evaluation.



## Goals for the Georgia Model of Student Growth

Beginning with the the Georgia Criterion Referenced Competency Tests (CRCT) and followed by the the Georgia Milestones Assessments,
Georgia has the capacity to calculate annual student growth across multiple content areas (e.g., Mathematics, English Language Arts, )
The Georgia Model of Student Growth has several goals.

1. Monitor the growth of students as they progress through the Georgia education system.
2. Evaluate the progress of students toward Georgia state
3. Use the results from the Georgia Model of Student Growth to draw valid inferences about education and educator quality.
